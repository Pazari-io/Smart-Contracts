-A one stop shop for launching a token, an NFT collection, and a decentralized website, with a built-in NFT exchange and token DEX for immediate trading. Deploy your very own crypto-powered decentralized online NFT store, deploy your very own NFT collection and immediately put it up for sale on the marketplace.
-Creators can create their own personal stores where they can sell blockchain based digital assets. These could be many things such as collectibles, social/fan tokens, or even custom metaverse items.
-All NFT metadata will be hosted on IPFS, not a private server, so the NFTs will have guaranteed persistence and decentralization.
-Each NFT collection will be a unique smart contract created by the platform according to the user's specifications. This can be done via contract factories, like those used by Uniswap for trading pairs.
-Creators will have access to their tokens' functions from their creator dashboard, and would be able to see every NFT they've created and who currently owns it.
-Creators will be able to automatically deploy a website and social media accounts, so creators can have their own online crypto shop created in a matter of minutes complete with all their socials and website statistics. These functions can be run separately as well, or not at all.
-Creators can use platform to host airdrops of NFTs and tokens

IF WE INCLUDE ERC20 TOKENS:
-Creators can create their own custom cryptocurrency token as well, and then provide liquidity for it on Trader Joe, or just sell it for a flat price in an ICO. Creators can use this to raise money for projects.
--Creators can also bank their income through Trader Joe to earn yield
--Users can swap tokens on the platform without going to Trader Joe





STEPS ON ROADMAP:
FRONT END:
-CLONE/FORK OPENSEA, TEST AND DEBUG
--Use this for the NFT marketplace
-TOKEN CREATION PAGE
-CREATOR DASHBOARD
--NFT collections created
--NFTs owned
--NFTs up for sale
--NFTs on watch list
--Stats

BACK END:
-BUILD CONTRACT FACTORY CONTRACT
--This is the contract which creates custom token contracts
--Make this contract upgradeable so we can add more customization in future
---Also need to optimize gas efficiency of custom contracts
---Upgrade feature needs to require multi-sig authorization to complete

-BUILD MARKETPLACE CONTRACT
--Decide if we want to integrate stablecoins or use AVAX
---Just use AVAX for now
--Integrate ERC1155 tokens into functions




GENERAL NOTES:
"People can upload their NFT, choose a theme, custom domain, buy and sell themes, explore NFTs on our main page (like opensea btw I check they take 2.5% we go with 1.5% xD). NFT STATS (some charts and ranking)"
