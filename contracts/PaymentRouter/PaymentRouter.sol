/**
 * PATCH NOTES:
 * - Added AccessControlPR contract, which replaces all access control functions with
 *   a single uniform contract that is easier to find and follow, see below.
 * - Replaced function modifiers with AccessControlPR modifiers
 * - Implemented a design where only Pazari-owned addresses can use the core functions
 *   of the PaymentRouter contract. This includes developer wallets, which later on
 *   can be removed and replaced with multi-sig contracts.
 * -  - Implemented a design that uses tx.origin and msg.sender to detect when a caller
 *   is calling from a Pazari contract versus a wallet. As long as we repeat this
 *   design through every contract it won't be vulnerable to phishing attacks. Take 
 *   a look at the _msgSender() function in PR, PMVP, and MP to make sure they are all
 *   the same design.
 * - Fixed a bug in holdTokens: PaymentRoute was being stored via paymentRouteID
 *   mapping, and mappings that return structs do NOT return arrays in the structs.
 *   I created a getter function to address this. This was causing all payments to
 *   go to one account. Now, holdTokens and pullTokens work as intended, while never
 *   resetting back to 0, thus saving buyers on gas costs.
 * -
